# ML_Model_Insights

This repository contains the implementation of **Task 4: Understand Your Model**, focusing on analyzing and interpreting a machine learning model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this task is to:
1. Understand which features are most important in predicting the target variable.
2. Analyze the modelâ€™s learning behavior.
3. Summarize findings and improvements after hyperparameter tuning.


## Notebook Highlights

### 1. Feature Importance
- Calculated feature importance using a tree-based model.
- Visualized the top features using a bar plot.

### 2. Learning Curves
- Plotted training and validation scores vs training set size.
- Analyzed overfitting and underfitting behavior.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Grid search or random search applied to improve model performance.
- Compared before and after tuning to observe improvements.

### 4. Summary Report
- Discussed the most important features and their impact.
- Noted improvements in performance after tuning.
- Documented final test accuracy.
- Included surprising insights encountered during the modeling process.
